Portability
-----------

This software was originally developed on an OpenStep machine running
Octave 2.0.11.

It uses GnuTerm.app (an OpenStep app wrapper around gnuplot) and some .ppm
display app such as ImageViewer.app. It uses a customised version of
image.m (which one day may make it back into the Octave distribution,
and a shellscript called xv which pretends ImageViewer.app is the
X-windows program.

The system has been tested under Linux RedHat 5.2. In theory any
machine running Octave will run the code. Matlab support has not been
tried, but should be straightforward.
