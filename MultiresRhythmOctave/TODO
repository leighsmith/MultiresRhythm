MorletWavelet(16, 2) produces a time support of about 70.
MorletWaveletFFT(64, 2) is pretty close in resolution. It's wrapped
around, but that is just ifft()'s behaviour. Its much lower in
amplitude, +/-1 vs +/- 0.05.

Need to find regions of phase congruency - where PC is high over the
widest number of scales
