* local-phase-congruency able to recompute using trig to catch boundary conditions?
* ridge extraction using energy measure, not just single continuity.
* shift
* sound file reading/writing code. - Surely the MusicKit or at least, libsndfile with CFFI.
* Phase issue, going strange on isochronous rhythms?
* NLISP print-object: print just subset of array unless a keyword is given :full
* Tempo selectivity
* Number of ridges as a measure of relative complexity?
