* local-phase-congruency able to recompute using trig to catch boundary conditions?
* MIDI file import & export
Via scorefiles?

* Create a preprocessing audio onset detector:
Sub-band filter, Rectify, LP smooth, differentiate, half-wave rectify & find the peak of
the signal region over a moving time limited window (use a DoG?)
Probably just implement Plymouth's model.

* Perceptual Onsets:
** Check unlimited cumulative sum vs. a windowed (leaky) integrating store.
** Check use of ridge persistency, instead of just scale persistency.
** Check GSL for cumsum etc.
** Fix print-object for (.rseq2 0 9 10)
** Gaussian weighting evaluation:
res4_1 works
res4_2 works
res4_3 doesn't
** Try picking local extrema regardless of how they relate to the beat.
** Make find-downbeat more robust to non-impulse rhythms. Don't allow crashes!
** Don't start clapping until the beat is strongly determined.
** Need bass drum accompaniment of tactus. Use two different tactus or subdivide tactus?
** Should tactus be incorporated into multires-analysis class?

* Expectancies
** Implement multiscale autocorrelation = Build version of rhythmACF in lisp.
** Use dyadic cwt and subdivide rhythm into dyadic chunks, say 2048 samples (10.24 seconds) so it avoids the padding issue.
** Correct the padding of nearly dyadic signals.
** Improve peak picking, either maximum of a sliding window, parabolic (quadratic lagrange) interpolation, or Gaussian mixture model.
** Check phase congruency on perceptual salience signals.

* ridge extraction using energy measure, not just single continuity.
* Tempo selection of ridges or weighting.
Currently weighting will reduce the energy of a
ridge but will not stop that ridge being selected. The selection criteria therefore
needs a height weighting, but this seems contradicted by some of the examples,
i.e. agogic grouping.

* Reduce scale range of cwt.
Set maximum and minimum scales to do wavelet analysis over.

* Span SBCL processes over grid cluster.
Need to use file locking when testing & generating output files.

* Recheck why there is a sinusoidal response to icwt single magnitude ridge
and not a Gaussian.


* Create a final ritard example
check the output when a dyadic vs. a non-dyadic window, may need significant silence.

* Sing to clicktrack?
Already done with Austrian folksongs.

* (fft (log (abs fft))) pulsewave identity

* Use a curve fitting function from the ridges to unify disjoint ridges.

* Make the wavelet annotation code a web app? 
Just set up a server, perhaps even the MCG server if the garbage bug is fixed.

* Check examples using Aksak rhythms.

* Check Euclid's GCD Algorithm

* Check Tactus of a minim for three blind mice example.

* Rhythms in non equal ratios but repeating the ratio as a rhythm.

* Should ritard modulating rhythm.
