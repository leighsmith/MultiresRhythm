* local-phase-congruency able to recompute using trig to catch boundary conditions?
* ridge extraction using energy measure, not just single continuity.
* Tempo selection of ridges or weighting.
Currently weighting will reduce the energy of a
ridge but will not stop that ridge being selected. The selection criteria therefore
needs a height weighting, but this seems contradicted by some of the examples,
i.e. agogic grouping.
* sound file reading/writing code. - Surely the MusicKit or at least, libsndfile with CFFI.
* MIDI file import & export
* Create a preprocessing audio onset detector:
Sub-band filter, Rectify, LP smooth, differentiate, half-wave rectify & find the peak of
the signal region over a moving time limited window (use a DoG?)
* Merge image writing Lisp code into nlisp to simplify distribution.
* Generate labelled ridge plots using image.

Perceptual Onsets:
* Check unlimited cumulative sum vs. a windowed (leaky) integrating store.
* Check Use of ridge persistency, instead of just scale persistency.
* Check GSL for cumsum etc.
* Fix print-object for (.rseq2 0 9 10)
* Implement multiscale autocorrelation.
* Gaussian weighting evaluation:
res4_1 works
res4_2 works
res4_3 doesn't
* Try picking local extrema regardless of how they relate to the beat.
* Make find-downbeat more robust to non-impulse rhythms. Don't allow crashes!
* Don't start clapping until the beat is strongly determined.
* Need bass drum accompaniment of tactus. Probably use two different tactus?
* Probably should subclass rhythm to rhythm-salience to manage both onsets and salience
trace.
* Should tactus be incorporated into multires-analysis?

* Use ridge persistency for meter determination.
* Build version of rhythmACF in lisp.
* Use dyadic cwt and subdivide rhythm into dyadic chunks, say 2048 samples (10.24 seconds)
* so it avoids the padding issue.
