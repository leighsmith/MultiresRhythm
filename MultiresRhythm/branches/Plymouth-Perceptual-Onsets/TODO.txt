* local-phase-congruency able to recompute using trig to catch boundary conditions?
* ridge extraction using energy measure, not just single continuity.
* Tempo selection of ridges or weighting.
Currently weighting will reduce the energy of a
ridge but will not stop that ridge being selected. The selection criteria therefore
needs a height weighting, but this seems contradicted by some of the examples,
i.e. agogic grouping.
* sound file reading/writing code. - Surely the MusicKit or at least, libsndfile with CFFI.
* MIDI file import & export
* Create a preprocessing audio onset detector:
Sub-band filter, Rectify, LP smooth, differentiate, half-wave rectify & find the peak of
the signal region over a moving time limited window (use a DoG?)
* Merge image writing Lisp code into nlisp to simplify distribution.
* Generate labelled ridge plots using image.
